    Keller was born on June 27, 1880, in Tuscumbia, Alabama, the daughter of Arthur Henley Keller (1836 to 1896), and his second wife, Catherine Everett (Adams) Keller (1856 to 1921), known as "Kate". Her family lived on a homestead, Ivy Green,that Helen's paternal grandfather had built decades earlier. </p>

    <h3><u>Illness</u></h3>

<p>At 19 months old, Keller contracted an unknown illness described by doctors as "an acute congestion of the stomach and the brain".Contemporary doctors believe it might have been meningitis, caused by the bacterium Neisseria meningitidis (meningococcus), or possibly Haemophilus influenzae. (This could have caused he same symptoms, but which is a less likely cause due to its 97% juvenile mortality rate at that time). The illness left Keller both deaf and blind. She lived, as she recalled in her autobiography, "At Sea in a dense Fog"</p>
   <p> At that time, Keller was able to communicate somewhat with Martha Washington, who was two years older and the daughter of the family cook, and understood the girl's signs. By the age of seven, Keller had more than 60 home signs to communicate with her family, and could distinguish people by the vibration of their footsteps.</p>
